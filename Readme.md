**Assignment Submission Portal**

**Overview**

This backend system provides a platform for users to upload assignments and for admins to review and manage them.

**Technologies Used**

* **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB

**Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/assignment-portal.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd assignment-portal
   npm install
   ```

**Configuration**

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=your_port_number
```

**Running the Application**

```bash
npm start
```

**Endpoints**

**User Endpoints:**

* **POST /register:** Registers a new user.
* **POST /login:** Logs in a user.
* **POST /upload:** Uploads an assignment.
* **GET /admins:** Fetches a list of all admins.

**Admin Endpoints:**

* **POST /register:** Registers a new admin.
* **POST /login:** Logs in an admin.
* **GET /assignments:** Fetches assignments tagged to the admin.
* **POST /assignments/:id/accept:** Accepts an assignment.
* **POST /assignments/:id/reject:** Rejects an assignment.

**Data Model**

The database schema consists of the following collections:

* **users:** Stores user information (username, password, email, etc.)
* **admins:** Stores admin information (username, password, email, etc.)
* **assignments:** Stores assignment information (user ID, admin ID, task, status, timestamp)

**Security Considerations**

* **Password Hashing:** Strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) is used.
* **Input Validation:** Input validation is implemented to prevent injection attacks.
* **Session Management:** Secure session management is used to protect user data.

**Additional Notes**

* **Error Handling:** Proper error handling and meaningful error messages are implemented.
* **Logging:** Logging is used for debugging and monitoring.
* **Testing:** Unit and integration tests are included to ensure code quality.
* **Performance Optimization:** Database queries and server-side code are optimized for performance.
* **Scalability:** Consider using a load balancer and scaling the application for increased traffic.
