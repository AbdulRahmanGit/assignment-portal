| POST   | `/register`        | Register a new user                                                          |
| POST   | `/login`           | Log in as a user                                                             |
| POST   | `/upload`          | Upload an assignment                                                         |
| GET    | `/admins`          | Fetch all registered admins                                                  |
| GET    | `/assignments`     | Fetch all assignments previously submitted, including their statuses (My Idea) |

### Admin Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                      | Description                                   |
|--------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/register`                   | Register a new admin                         |
| POST   | `/login`                      | Log in as an admin                           |
| GET    | `/assignments`               | Fetch assignments tagged to the logged admin |
| POST   | `/assignments/:id/accept`     | Accept a specific assignment                 |
| POST   | `/assignments/:id/reject`     | Reject a specific assignment                 |

**Note:** The `GET /assignments` endpoint allows both users and admins to retrieve previously submitted assignments, including their statuses (e.g., pending, accepted, rejected). This was **my idea** to enhance visibility for all users and admins.

---

## Workflow

1. **Users** register or log in and can view the list of admins using the `/admins` endpoint.
2. They upload assignments tagged to specific admins using the `/upload` endpoint.
3. **Admins** log in to fetch assignments tagged to them using `/assignments`.
4. Admins can then accept or reject assignments using `/assignments/:id/accept` or `/assignments/:id/reject`.
